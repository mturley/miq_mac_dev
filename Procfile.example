# Web server workers
# The $PORT variable is set automatically by foreman for particular workers
# We tell foreman to start at 3000, it then increments by 1 per instance of a worker type
# and 100 per worker type.
#
# So, the first ui worker will get PORT=3000 while the next will get PORT=3001
# The first api worker will get PORT=3100 and the next will get PORT=3101
ui:        env PORT=$PORT bundle exec rails r lib/workers/bin/run_single_worker.rb MiqUiWorker
api:       env PORT=$PORT bundle exec rails r lib/workers/bin/run_single_worker.rb MiqWebServiceWorker
websocket: env PORT=$PORT bundle exec rails r lib/workers/bin/run_single_worker.rb MiqWebsocketWorker
#webpack:   env PORT=$PORT bundle exec bin/webpack-dev-server
# schedule: bundle exec rails r lib/workers/bin/run_single_worker.rb MiqScheduleWorker
# Queue workers
# These workers use a default queue defined in their classes
# We do not need to pass them a queue name
# generic:           bundle exec rails r lib/workers/bin/run_single_worker.rb MiqGenericWorker
# priority:          bundle exec rails r lib/workers/bin/run_single_worker.rb MiqPriorityWorker
# event:             bundle exec rails r lib/workers/bin/run_single_worker.rb MiqEventHandler
# reporting:         bundle exec rails r lib/workers/bin/run_single_worker.rb MiqReportingWorker
# metrics_processor: bundle exec rails r lib/workers/bin/run_single_worker.rb MiqEmsMetricsProcessorWorker
# Provider workers
#
# If you are unsure which workers to start, you can run `ruby lib/workers/bin/run_single_worker.rb -l` to list the workers available
# VMware example
# The following workers should be started to work with a VMware infrastructure EMS
# vim_broker:     bundle exec rails r lib/workers/bin/run_single_worker.rb MiqVimBrokerWorker
# vmware_metrics: bundle exec rails r lib/workers/bin/run_single_worker.rb ManageIQ::Providers::Vmware::InfraManager::MetricsCollectorWorker
# Per EMS queue workers
# These workers subscribe to a queue named based on the particular EMS they connect to
# The "<id>" tag in these lines should be replaced by the id of the manager instance these workers apply to
# vmware_refresh_<id>:      env QUEUE=ems_<id> bundle exec rails r lib/workers/bin/run_single_worker.rb ManageIQ::Providers::Vmware::InfraManager::RefreshWorker
# vmware_event_<id>:        env QUEUE=ems_<id> bundle exec rails r lib/workers/bin/run_single_worker.rb ManageIQ::Providers::Vmware::InfraManager::EventCatcher
# vmware_refresh_core_<id>: env QUEUE=ems_<id> bundle exec rails r lib/workers/bin/run_single_worker.rb MiqEmsRefreshCoreWorker

# If you also want to see the log output in the same terminal session that you see the foreman output, uncomment these lines
